# Vue-Easy-DnD 
### A HTML5 drag-and-drop replacement
Easy-DnD is a drag and drop implementation for Vue that uses only standard mouse events instead of the HTML5 drag and drop API, which is [impossible to work with](https://www.quirksmode.org/blog/archives/2009/09/the_html5_drag.html).

Think of it as a way to transfer data from some components to others using the mouse or support for a mouse assisted copy/cut - paste. It also allows for lists to be reordered by drag and drop.
